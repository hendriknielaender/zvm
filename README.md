zvm is a command-line tool that allows you to easily install, manage, and switch between multiple versions of Zig.

## Features

- List available Zig versions.
- Install specific Zig versions.
- Switch between installed Zig versions.
- Set a default Zig version.


## Install

To install zvm with Homebrew, aka. `brew`, run the following commands:

```bash
brew tap hendriknielaender/zvm
brew install zvm
```

Now add this line to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.zshrc` file.

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.zm/current:$PATH"
```

## Usage
```bash
zvm list                # List all available Zig versions
zvm install <version>   # Install a specified Zig version
zvm use <version>       # Switch to a specified Zig version for the current session
zvm default <version>   # Set a specified version as the default
zvm current             # Display the currently active Zig version
zvm --help              # Displays help information
zvm --version           # Display zvm version
```

### Compatibility Notes
Zig is in active development and the APIs can change frequently, making it challenging to support every dev build. This project currently aims to be compatible with stable, non-development builds to provide a consistent experience for the users.

***Supported Version***: As of now, zvm is tested and supported on Zig version ***0.11.0***.
